This project aims to collect and sort out existing foraminifera census data in the LGM.
+ Author: Rui Ying (rui.ying@bristol.ac.uk)

* Structure
+ raw: raw data after cleaning
+ fg: functionl group level data in each project
+ sp: species level data in each project
+ tidy: combine the lgm and forcens in fg/sp or absolute/relative abundance

* Data Sources
[[file:raw/RAEDME.txt][Data description]]

* Data Clean Steps
+ 0 read raw data in wide format
+ 1 clean and replace column name
+ 2 generate species-based relative/absolute abundance (long format, in `sp` folder)
+ 3 generate functional group-based relative/absolute abundance (long format, in `fg` folder)
+ 4 merge all data in lgm in long format and convert to wide format (in `tidy` folder, sp in abbreviation)
+ 5 Add SST in each lgm data

* Others
+ Taxonomy: Brummer and Kucera (2022)
+ Relative abundance: all in decimal format (0-1)
+ NA: replace NA with 0 (absence is still information)
