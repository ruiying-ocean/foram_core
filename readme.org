* About

This project aims to collect and sort out existing foraminifera census data in the Last Glacial Maximum, which will be used to construct foraminifera thermal performance curves.

* Structure and file name
+ /raw: raw data
+ /fg: functional group data in each core/data compilation
+ /sp: species level data each core/data compilation
+ /tidy: combined lgm and forcens in fg/sp or absolute/relative abundance. SST are assigned according to the georeferences.

All the data follows the name pattern "[lgm/forcens]_[core]_[fg/sp]_[a/r].csv", where a/r is absolute or relative abundance.

* Raw Data Sources
** [[file:raw/RAEDME.org][Foraminifera abundance data]]
** LGM Sea Surface Temperature

* Data cleaning
** Conceptual Steps
+ 0 read raw data in wide format
+ 1 clean and replace column name
+ 2 generate species-based relative/absolute abundance (long format, in `sp` folder)
+ 3 generate functional group-based relative/absolute abundance (long format, in `fg` folder)
+ 4 merge all data in lgm in long format and convert to wide format (in `tidy` folder, sp in abbreviation)
+ 5 Add annual mean SST in each lgm data

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Taxonomy in this project is as Brummer and Kucera (2022). And relative abundance is in decimal format (0-1) not percentage.
#+END_QUOTE

* Use the repository
+ The ready-to-use data are placed under the `tidy/` folder
+ (optionally) Re-compile the data: open lgm_foram_core.Rproject in RStudio and follow the prompt selection.
