#+TITLE: Foraminifera Census Data Compilation in the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ka)

* About

This project aims to collect and sort out existing foraminifera census data in the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ka). These data, as those of pre-industrial project, will be used to construct foraminifera thermal performance curves.

+ Publication citation: Ying, R., Monteiro, F. M., Wilson, J. D., & Schmidt, D. N. (2023). in submission

* Structure
+ /raw: raw data after cleaning
+ /fg: functionl group level data in each project
+ /sp: species level data in each project
+ /tidy: combined lgm and forcens in fg/sp or absolute/relative abundance. SST are assigned according to the georeferences.

* Raw Data Sources
** [[file:raw/RAEDME.txt][Foraminifera global abundance]]
** LGM Sea Surface Temperature

* Data cleaning
** Conceptual Steps
+ 0 read raw data in wide format
+ 1 clean and replace column name
+ 2 generate species-based relative/absolute abundance (long format, in `sp` folder)
+ 3 generate functional group-based relative/absolute abundance (long format, in `fg` folder)
+ 4 merge all data in lgm in long format and convert to wide format (in `tidy` folder, sp in abbreviation)
+ 5 Add SST in each lgm data

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Taxonomy in this project is as Brummer and Kucera (2022). And relative abundance is in decimal format (0-1) not percentage.
